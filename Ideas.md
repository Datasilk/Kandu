### Ideas for unique features

* #### Timeline
    * Months & years, starting from the current year, are displayed virtically down the page as horizontal lines
    * Major events are displayed in each list as cards, with two columns of cards, one on each side of a thick line going down the center of the list
	* Less important, overlapping events are displayed as clickable dots stuck to the thick vertical line that runs down the center of each list. 
	* Each event dot appears on the line vertically where it belongs in the timeline, based on the card's due date.
	* When a dot is clicked on, major event cards disappear behind the newly displayed card associated with the dot

* #### Bulletin Boards
	* A stylish home page for users, where they can drag & drop boards as "sticky notes" on a billboard.
	* Various tools are available, such as pins & strings, various colored markers, pens, and even polaroid photos (from image uploads)
	* User can create multiple billboards and tab through them as well as view a list of billboards
